  <div class="header">  <h1>Lab 1, CSC/CPE 203 - Python to Java (types)</h1></div>

<h2>Orientation – Explicit Types, semi-colons, and curly braces</h2>
<p>
This lab is designed to highlight some of the differences between Python and 
Java.  Many of the differences are purely syntactical.  Other features, 
like for loops, function differently.  Those already familiar with Java 
should finish the lab and then offer to help others.

</p>
<div class="header">
<h2>Objectives</h2>
</div>

<ul>
<li>To submit an assignment using github.
<li>To translate a Python program to Java.
<li>To develop and run a complete Java program.
<li>To compile and run a Java program on unix1-5
</ul>

<div class="header">
<h2>Resources</h2>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Your peers</li>
<li>Your instructor</li>
<li>The <a href="~/cpe203/materials/labs/lab01">Java Standard Library </a>- Bookmark this web page, you will be using the Java Standard Library documentation regularly this quarter.</li>
</ul>

<div class="header">
<h2>Administration</h2>
</div>

<p>Before you get started, you need to set things up.  Assuming you've created
your git repositories as requested, you next need to copy this lab into your
turnin directory.  Copy the directory lab01 to the turnin-XXX directory you
created when you accepted the "turn in" assignment, where "XXX" is your
github ID.  You'll do your work in this copy.  In Unix, you can copy a 
file or directory using the <code>cp</code> command.
For example, from the
main directory for CSC 203, you can copy this lab into your turnin directory
with:
<blockquote><pre>cp -r materials/labs/lab01 turnin-XXX/ </pre></blockquote>
where XXX is your github ID.
<p>
You need to create two files in your turnin-xxx directory:  <code>email.txt</code>
and <code>name.txt</code>  In <code>email.txt</code>, put your @calpoly.edu e-mail
address.  In <code>name.txt</code>, put your name, exactly as it appears in PolyLearn.
<p>
Be sure to read all of the directions in <code>materials/setup.txt</code>.
In particular, make sure you create a repository called "turnin-XXX" (where
XXX is your github login ID), by accepting the assignment link given in the
first bullet point in <code>materials/setup.txt</code>.  This step is necessary
for you to receive grades.
<p>
Completing the above steps will be part of your grade.

<h2>Ground Rules</h2>
</div>

<p>You may collaborate with your peers as much as you like on this lab. Labs are for your practice. Make sure you can do every lab!</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Setup</h2>
</div>

<p>
For this lab you are required to compile and run Java from the
command-line.  
</p>

<p>
To compile the java lab code file, type:
<p>
<code>javac Lab01.java</code>
</p>
To run the code then type:
<p>
<code>java Lab01</code>
</p>

 
<div class="header">
<h2>Specification</h2>
</div>
 
<ol> 
<li>The starting code is in a directory called <code>src</code>.  Throughout this class, we will always put source code in a directory called <code>src</code>.
<li>From the starting code run <code>lab01.py</code>.  Make sure you understand how everything in this file works. If you need help (or haven’t learned Python) please ask me or a classmate to explain things.  You will NOT be tested on Python this quarter, but will need to understand this file enough to write an equivalent java version.
 
<li> Now take a look at the file <code>Lab01.java</code>.  This file is incomplete and you will need to finish it.  Translate the given Python file to Java.  Please translate everything, including the comments!
 
To compile your files, type:
<p>
<code>javac Lab01.java</code>
</p>
To run the code then type:
<p>
<code>java Lab01</code>
</p>
</ol>

<div class="header">
<h2>Submitting the Lab</h2>
</div>

<p>Commit your working program to Github.  See 
<code>info/git_commands.txt</code> for details on
the commands <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>
and <code>git push</code> that you use to do this.  By the day 
after the due date, be prepared to demonstrate your working 
program to your instructor, and show your source code.</p>
<p>
If you'd like to submit the lab one day late with a penalty of 5%, 
please add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the 
<code>lab01</code> directory.  If you'd like to submit the lab two 
days late with a penalty of 15%, add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the <code>lab01</code>
directory.  Make sure you add and push the late file.
<p>
After your code is working and submitted,
check your submission using the <code>checkgit</code> command on the
unix server.  If the autograder can't compile your lab for a reason that
is caught by <code>checkgit</code>, you will get a zero on the lab.  To
check your submission, on a Unix server type:
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 lab01</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If it works, you will see the message "** Tests Passed **".  If not,
you will see some kind of error message.  The error message might not tell
you exactly what you need to change, but it should give an indication as
to what is wrong.
